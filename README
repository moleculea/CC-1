Assignment 1: On-demand Elastic IT Infrastructure

Prerequisites:
    1. Install AWS SDK for Python (Boto): boto 2.14
        $ pip install boto

    2. Set environment variables for credentials at ~/.boto:
        [Credentials]
        aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>
        aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> 

Usage:
    $ python run.py control_argument

    control_argument:

        init         -- Initialize instances (one-time operation)
                        Create and launch instances from public AMIs provided by AWS

        store        -- Store idle instances
                        Detach data volumes from instances, create volume snapshots, create AMIs and terminate instances

        store-s3     -- Same as `store', except copying snapshots to Amazon S3
                        using copy_snapshot()

        store-force  -- Store all instances

        restore      -- Restore instances
                        Launch instances from AMIs, create volume from volume 
                        snapshots and attach volumes to the instances

        list         -- List instances
                        List currently running instances

        scale        -- Autoscale instances
                        Create Autoscale groups and scaling alarms

        nscale       -- Stop autoscale
                        Delete Autoscale groups

        flushdb      -- Flush local DB files

        s3-init      -- Initialize S3 bucket (one-time operation)

        s3-put       -- Put a file to S3

        s3-get       -- Get a file from S3

        s3-print     -- Print the content of a file as string from S3
